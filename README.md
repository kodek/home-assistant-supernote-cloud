Bring your Ratta Supernote e-ink tablet into your smart home ecosystem. This integration connects Home Assistant to a **Supernote Private Cloud**, allowing you to monitor device storage capacity, browse notebook pages dynamically, and interact with your handwritten notes using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Home Assistant Assist.

It is designed to pair natively with both the official [Supernote Private Cloud](https://support.supernote.com/en_US/Whats-New/setting-up-your-own-supernote-private-cloud-beta) and your own self-hosted **[Supernote Personal Knowledge Hub](https://github.com/allenporter/supernote)** with built-in AI features (such as notebook transcription and semantic search).

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 AI & LLM Assistants (The Novel Layer)

This integration registers custom tools with Home Assistant's LLM engine, enabling conversational agents (such as Google Gemini in Home Assistant) to read, search, and answer questions about your notes.

- **Semantic Search (`search_supernote`)**: Allows LLMs to search for concepts across your handwritten notebook library using vector similarity search.
- **Notebook Transcripts (`get_supernote_transcript`)**: Exposes the text transcript of any notebook or journal to the model.
- **Companion Integrations**: Pairs perfectly with **[Journal Assistant](https://github.com/allenporter/home-assistant-journal-assistant)** and **[Supernote LLM](https://github.com/allenporter/supernote-llm/)** to convert handwritten bullet journals into structured calendar events and PKM insights.

### 🖼️ Dynamic Notebook Rendering (Media Source)

Exposes your notebook library via Home Assistant's native **Media Browser**.

- Browse folders and files synced from your tablet.
- View notebook pages rendered dynamically on-the-fly as `.png` images directly in the Home Assistant UI or cast them to media players.

### 📊 Storage Capacity Sensors

Keep track of your cloud account's storage capacity. The integration registers four sensors polled automatically every 30 minutes:

- **Storage Used** (in GB)
- **Storage Total** (in GB)
- **Storage Free** (in GB)
- **Storage Usage Ratio** (in %)

## 🔒 Supported Cloud Options

This component supports the following sync infrastructure options:

- **Self-Hosted Server with AI (Recommended)**: Integrates seamlessly with **[allenporter/supernote](https://github.com/allenporter/supernote)**, a lightweight, SQLite-backed private cloud server with built-in Gemini AI features.
  - **Local Ownership**: Sync your notes directly to a local database running in your home lab, NAS, or private server.
  - **AI Integration**: Unlocks semantic search and note transcription features for LLM tools.
  - **Highly Efficient**: Consumes less than ~200MB of memory at idle.
- **Generic Private Cloud**: Works with standard implementations of the Supernote Private Cloud protocol (such as the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/allenporter/supernote/tree/main/api-spec) documented in the self-hosted project).
